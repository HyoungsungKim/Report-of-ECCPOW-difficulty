# Likelihood Construction, Inference for Parametric Survival Distributions

https://web.stanford.edu/~lutian/coursepdf/unit2.pdf

While the focus of this course is on non-parametric and semi-parametric inference, it is useful to consider parametric inference for right-censored survival data for at least two reasons:

- First, parametric inference can be very helpful in settings with small sample sizes or when scientific insights can be gleaned from the shapes of survival curves;
- Secondly, such inferences provide a useful contrast to inference in more traditional settings, where the observations are direct realizations from the underlying distribution of interest.
  - When observations are subject to censoring, then likelihood methods inform us about the distribution of the observables, which depends on both the underlying survival process and the process that leads to censored observations.
