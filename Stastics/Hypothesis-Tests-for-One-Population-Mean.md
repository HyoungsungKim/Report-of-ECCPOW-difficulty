# Hypothesis Tests for One Population Mean

To make that decision, we can take a random sample of people imprisoned last year for drug offenses, compute their sample mean sentence, $$\bar{x}$$, and then apply a statistical-inference technique called a ***hypothesis test***.

In this chapter, we describe hypothesis tests for one population mean. In doing so, we consider three different procedures.

- The first two are called the one-mean z-test and the one-mean t-test, which are the hypothesis-test analogues of the one-mean z-interval and one-mean t-interval confidence-interval procedures, respectively, discussed in Chapter 8.
- The third is a nonparametric method called the ***Wilcoxon signed-rank test***, which applies when the variable under consideration has a symmetric distribution.

We also examine two different approaches to hypothesis testing—namely, the critical-value approach and the P-value approach.

## 9.1 The Nature of Hypothesis Testing

A hypothesis is a statement that something is true. For example, the statement “the mean weight of all bags of pretzels packaged differs from the advertised weight of 454 g” is a hypothesis. Typically, a hypothesis test involves two hypotheses: the ***null hypothesis*** and the ***alternative hypothesis*** (or research hypothesis)

- Null hypothesis: A hypothesis to be tested. We use the symbol $$H_0$$ to represent the null hypothesis.
- Alternative hypothesis: A hypothesis to be considered as an alternative to the null hypothesis. We use the symbol $$H_a$$ to represent the alternative hypothesis.
- Hypothesis test: The problem in a hypothesis test is to decide whether the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
